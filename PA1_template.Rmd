## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
act1<-read.csv("./activity.csv")
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
activity<-tbl_df(act1)
rm("act1")
activity<-mutate(activity, Year=year(date), Month=month(date), Mday=mday(date),Wday=wday(date))
```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

summarise(group_by(activity, date), sum(steps))

summarise(group_by(activity, date), Mean_Steps=mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE))

summarise(group_by(activity, date), Median_Steps=median(steps, na.rm=TRUE))




## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
